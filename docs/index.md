## Object Validator Pro (OVP)

#### What is OVP?
Object-Validator-Pro provides a very simple API for developers to make both **Sync** and **Async** validations on any javascript object.

To Use OVP efficiently, you need to understand how it validates each key in any given object against its rules.
Unlike other validation libraries, OVP is best for your **custom validation rules**.

You can create your own validation library out of OVP and use them in as many projects as you want.

**You set your rules just the way you understand them.**
